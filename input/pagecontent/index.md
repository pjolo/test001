### Introduction
The **emergency record** contains all the important medical information needed in situations in which quick access or a quick overview of medical data is required. For example, in cases of unconsciousness, language barriers or limited health lieracy.   
The emergency record combines key administrative and clinicel data such as patient details, emergency contacts, medication, allergies, vaccinations, implants, diognose, CPR status and references to living wills and other relevant documents.

The CH EMER implementation guide describes the FHIR representation of the electronic emergency record in Switzerland. It is dependent on [CH Core](http://fhir.ch/ig/ch-core/index.html) and [CH Term](http://fhir.ch/ig/ch-term/index.html), which describe the Swiss-specific context, particularly in relation to the Swiss Electronic Patient Record (EPR).   
This implementation guide is based on the concept for the exchange format of the electronic emergency record ([de](https://www.e-health-suisse.ch/upload/documents/Konzept_eNotfallpass_DE.pdf), [fr](https://www.e-health-suisse.ch/upload/documents/Konzept_Notfallpass_FR.pdf)).

### Objective

The emergency report is designed to give medical professionals quick and structured access to a patient's most important medical information in emergency situations.
